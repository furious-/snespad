# SNESpad

This is the code I made for my Arduino board (ATmega32u4), it has USB HID support to make our gamepad works like a real joystick in our computer.



## Features

- It works like a normal USB gamepad.

- It can send hotkeys as keyboard when you hold some buttons on controller.



## How-to

1. You need 3 wires from the controller to get this working: Latch, Clock, Data

2. You can directly solder the wires on the console port or use an extension cable (recommended)

3. On your board, you can use any pin, just make sure to setup it right on the code

4. Upload the code. Done(?)

I made an online Input Viewer as well, it can be used directly on your streaming software (if it has Browser Source, of course). Just use this url: https://furious.github.io/snespad
